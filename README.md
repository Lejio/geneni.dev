# Welcome to my Portfolio

Hi! I am a senior studying Information Science at the University of Maryland, College Park.

I have a knack for creating performant full stack applications!

I primarily use **Python** and **TypeScript**. I know, I know—"You call Python and TypeScript performant?" But what excites me is building applications using optimization techniques like pre-fetching and caching to deliver snappy user experiences.

Currently, I’m diving into **Rust** as a scalable backend language to enhance my toolkit.

Next up is **Elixir**—and I’ve been hearing amazing things about it. I mean, automatic fault detection and recovery built right in? How cool is that?
